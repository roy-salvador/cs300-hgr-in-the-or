# cs300-hgr-in-the-or

A Medical Image Navigation prototype application powered by hand gesture commands, created to demonstrate the feasibility of a Deep Learning and Computer Vision-based Hand Gesture Recognition System for Operating Room usage. A deliverable requirement for CS 300 Thesis course, successfully defended Midyear 2020 at the University of the Philippines Diliman under Sir Prospero Naval.
